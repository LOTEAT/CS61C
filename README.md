# CS61C-Proj1-Game of Life

It is a game of life implemented by C. 
For most of apis, it is easy to work it out.
I think the most hardest is the rule of the game.
For the game, we have a `rule(0xabcd)`. 
For each cell, if it is alive, the next state is decided by `ab`;
if it is dead, the next state is determined by `cd`.

The end result is like this.
